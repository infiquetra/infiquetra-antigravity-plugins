  Native Antigravity multi-agent consensus workflow. Spawns parallel workers and reviewers with a 0-10 scoring loop and automatic fix routing.
when_to_use: |
  Use this skill when you want to execute a non-trivial plan using a team of autonomous subagents.
  - The plan has 3+ steps, touches 3+ files, or involves docs/specs
  - The plan involves multiple parallel work streams
  - The user says: "agent team", "use agents", "set up a team", "consensus review", "agentic approach", "run this with agents"

# Multi-Agent Consensus Skill

This skill provides a structured workflow for executing plans using Antigravity's native subagent capabilities. You (the main agent) will act as the **Team Lead**. You will use the `invoke_subagent` tool to spawn workers and reviewers, orchestrate their execution, and enforce a strict consensus protocol.

## Step 1: Worker Kickoff

1. Break the plan down into independent phases or work streams.
2. For each independent work stream, define a concise task description.
3. Use a single `invoke_subagent` tool call to launch all parallel workers at once.
   - Set `TypeName: "self"` (or `"research"` if it's a read-only task).
   - Set `Role: "[Phase Name] Worker"`.
   - Set `Prompt: "[Task description and codebase context]"`.
4. **Wait** for all workers to finish their tasks and report back via native reactive wakeups. If a worker gets blocked, read their message and send them unblocking instructions using `send_message`.

## Step 2: Reviewer Kickoff

Once the workers have completed their implementations, you must run the **Consensus Protocol**.

1. Identify the necessary Reviewer personas for the changes made.
   - **Base Reviewers** (Always include these 3): `devils-advocate-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `architecture-reviewer`.
   - **Optional Reviewers**: Include others if relevant (e.g., `api-reviewer`, `testing-reviewer`, `infra-reviewer`, `privacy-reviewer`, `clarity-reviewer`, `code-quality-reviewer`, `ai-usefulness-reviewer`).
2. Read the selected personas from the `multi-agent-consensus/skills/multi-agent-consensus/references/personas/` directory to get their system prompts.
3. Read the review criteria from `multi-agent-consensus/skills/multi-agent-consensus/references/review-criteria.md`.
4. Gather the git diff of the changes made by the workers. Filter out lockfiles and binary assets to save tokens.
5. Use `invoke_subagent` to spawn the reviewers concurrently.
   - Set `TypeName: "self"`.
   - Set `Role: "[Reviewer Name]"`.
   - Set `Prompt: "[Persona Instructions] + [Review Criteria] + Please review the following diff: [Git Diff]"`.

## Step 3: Consensus Cycle & Fix Routing

1. Wait for all reviewers to reply with their evaluations and their 0-10 scores.
2. **Consensus Check**: All reviewers must score **>= 9.0/10**.
   - If **ALL >= 9.0**: Consensus reached! Proceed to Completion (Step 4).
   - If **ANY < 9.0**: Consensus NOT reached. Consolidate and deduplicate their fix requests.
3. **Fix Routing**:
   - For minor textual or formatting fixes, you (the Team Lead) should implement them directly to save time.
   - For complex logic or architectural fixes, use `send_message` to send the consolidated feedback back to the specific worker subagent(s) that originally wrote the code.
4. **Re-Review**: Once fixes are applied, use `send_message` to send the updated diff ONLY to the reviewers who previously scored < 9.0. (Do not recreate the subagents, just message the active ones).
5. **Cycle Cap**: Repeat this process for a maximum of **3 iterations**. After 3 iterations, proceed to Completion regardless of scores, but document the unresolved issues.
   - *Blocking Exception*: If any Security or Auth dimension scores < 5.0, immediately halt the process and flag the issue to the user. This is a hard stop.

## Step 4: Completion

Generate a summary report for the user detailing:
1. How many review cycles were run.
2. The final scores and verdicts from all reviewers in a markdown table.
3. Whether consensus was reached.
4. Any unresolved issues (if the 3-cycle cap was hit).
5. A summary of the final changes implemented.

## Step 4: Validators and Automation Gates

Before completing the consensus process, you must run automated validators to check for regressions.
Validators are static subagents in `plugins/multi-agent-consensus/agents/` that should be invoked with `TypeName`.

Validator configurations can be found in `.multi-agent-consensus.json` which specifies:
- `required_validators`
- `disabled_validators`
- `nonprod_workflows`
- `scenario_hints`
- `smoke_targets`

Write validator evidence state to `.gemini/multi-agent-consensus/validators/`.

Automation is allowed only when all conditions are true:
- Remote matches `github.com/infiquetra/*`.
- The workflow is explicitly nonprod or publish-nonprod.
- Reviewer consensus and scanner gates passed.

Run testers after deployment. If testers hard-fail, run a maximum 3 remediation loops before escalating to the user.
